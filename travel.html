        <h2>Barcelona</h2>

        <p>
          Barcelona, is a beautiful city on the Northeastern coast of Spain that
          is the byproduct of a rich and artistic history with modern
          infrastructure. One of the main attractions of the city is its
          gorgeous architecture, often the work of world renowned architects
          such as Antoni Gaudi. Some of the most notable works are the modern
          Basilica of La Sagrada Familia, and the tranquil and eloquent Park
          Güell.
        </p>
        <p>
          Much of Barcelona’s charm comes down to local culture, from diverse
          culinary offerings, to the sunny vacation-ridden atmosphere of the
          beaches, and even the symbolism of nationalism and independence that
          Barcelona residents display. The passion of the locals is unwavering,
          including in famous soccer matches by one of the sports greatest
          clubs: F.C. Barcelona, and in numerous local artistry events. It is no
          wonder why many travelers to Spain feel rejuvenated and fortunate
          enough to have experienced the city’s irresistibly strong culture and
          atmosphere.

          Milktea is a Scottish fold with a personality of a princess. She loves
          her veggies and refuses to eat anything dropped on the ground. She
          makes it clear when she has a demand of any sort by complaining in a
          loud, distinguished manner. If what she says could be translated, it
          probably would be, “This is atrocious, the water container has been
          empty for the 3rd time this week. I want to see the manager.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite her cuteness and royalty, she actually suffers from a genetic
          disorder intentionally brought upon by humans. I highly advise against
          keeping a Scottish fold because they are in constant pain when they
          reach around 2 years old. Cartilage accumulates around her paw joints
          and tail joints and it becomes painful for them to even walk. She is
          living evidence of human’s cruelty of breeding animals to look pretty
          while sacrificing the animals’ health.
