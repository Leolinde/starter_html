          Biscuit is a 2 year old shiba inu dog. Shiba inus are energetic and
          playful dogs. Biscuit enjoys running outside in circles and then
          laying down in the grass in the sun for hours. He also likes going for
          occasional swims.
        </p>
        <p>
          As energetic as Biscuit is, he also likes to relax. He loves to sleep
          in his dog bed and watch Netflix with his owners. His favorite treat
          is apples.
        </p>

        <p>
          York loves to stay active and go on long walks by his house. He also
          enjoys chewing on his large assortment of toys. His favorite toy is
          his squeaky pig. York’s favorite food is sausage, but cheese is
          another favorite.
        </p>
        <p>
          York is a very sociable dog and is a licensed therapy dog. He
          frequently visits nursing homes and other places in an attempt to
          raise peoples’ spirits. When it comes to bedtime, York prefers to
          sleep alone in his favorite blue dog bed. He will always be the first
          to get up in the morning.

          Bo is a Portuguese Water Dog with black and white fur. His paws are
          white too, so they always get dirty when outside. He is 12 years old,
          but he still likes to run around outside a lot.
        </p>
        <p>
          He has an abundance of toys but only likes to play with a couple. He
          enjoys going on walks and especially on trails in the woods. He has a
          few dog friends that he likes to go on playdates with as well.

        <h2>Milktea</h2>
        <img
          src="images/Main.jpg"
          alt="Milktea taking nap"
          style="width: 400px"
        />
        <p>
          Milktea is a Scottish fold with a personality of a princess. She loves
          her veggies and refuses to eat anything dropped on the ground. She
          makes it clear when she has a demand of any sort by complaining in a
          loud, distinguished manner. If what she says could be translated, it
          probably would be, “This is atrocious, the water container has been
          empty for the 3rd time this week. I want to see the manager.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite her cuteness and royalty, she actually suffers from a genetic
          disorder intentionally brought upon by humans. I highly advise against
          keeping a Scottish fold because they are in constant pain when they
          reach around 2 years old. Cartilage accumulates around her paw joints
          and tail joints and it becomes painful for them to even walk. She is
          living evidence of human’s cruelty of breeding animals to look pretty
          while sacrificing the animals’ health.

        <p>
          Jax is a kitten, about five months old that I found this summer at a
          gas station while traveling to Marquette, Michigan. He was scared and
          malnourished, crying in the parking lot. I took him with me and after
          some healthy meals and a trip to the vet he is doing great!
        </p>
        <p>
          My roommates and I just recently moved and Jax has been having a hard
          time getting used to the large house since we were previously living
          in a small apartment. Jax is incredibly playful and loves to run
          around, but when he is sleepy he is happy to be held.
