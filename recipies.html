        <p>
          Pesto pasta has always been a comfort dish for me; it’s quick, it’s
          easy, and great food for a dinner party or a comfy night in! It
          requires six main ingredients, plus additional spices as you see fit.
          If you’re not in the mood for pasta, you can always eat the pesto
          sauce on bread, crackers, or eggs! This recipe makes enough for around
          4 people, so adjust accordingly.
